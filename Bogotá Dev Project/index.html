            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>...to my first Bogotá Dev Project, a website all about me, Christopher Brum.
                Wow, I’m uncomfortable already, but here goes nothing. Come along with me on this
                extremely brief yet incredibly factually accurate voyage of my life and aspirations,
                past, present and future. All aboard…</p>
        </div>

        <div class="early">
            <h3 id="early-nav">Early Chris</h3>
            <p>It all began in the year 1983. I fell into this world in an area popularly known as
                California and have resided there my entire life up until now. Just your average 80’s
                baby upbringing in a suburb of San Francisco, really. School, birthdays, older sister
                beating me up, teenage mutant ninja turtles, little sister showed up at some point,
                braces, grunge music. That last item was particularly important to me and led me starting
                playing music and playing in bands with my friends and which eventually took my life
                over for about a decade. Yup, my twenties were a lot of playing in smelly basements,
                dingy clubs or peoples living rooms. It was a blast. I was even able to travel through
                Asia, Europe and North America several times doing so. After a while that lifestyle was
                a bit hard to sustain and I began pondering on what I wanted out of life. </p><br>

            <p>One thing I found to be extremely interesting while in my twenties was visiting places
                I’d never been. Traveling while playing music allowed me to see many places I’d
                never seen before, but it only gave me a glimpse of these places. A day in a new city or country
                is just not sufficient to explore properly. It was also around this time that I really
                was becoming obsessed with motorcycling. Strangely enough it seemed to scratch the same
                sort of itch that playing music, but without the necessity for a group of other
                friends to collaborate with. The idea of utilizing my motorcycle to explore places I
                had never been began to grow into an obession. A month long trip across the US turned into a trip to Mexico,
                which turned into a trip to Patagonia, which ultimately turned into an open-ended journey
                to see the world from the saddle of my motorcycle. My desire to travel indefinitely means
                that I will need to be able to make some type of income remotely, and thats when I found
                the Bogotá Dev Bootcamp and decided a change of occupation was in order. </p>

        <div class="future">
            <h3 id="future-nav">Future Chris</h3>
            <p>Having been a remodeling contractor my whole adult life the idea of working as a Developer in
                some capacity was and is a bit daunting. I am reasonably confident in my ability to
                learn new skills and I can dedicate myself to overcoming things outside of my skillset, but
                I have no, I mean NO experience with computer based technology other than utilizing google
                maps on my phone or sending gifs to my mom. Cue the anxiety. I have been
                practicing on Codecademy for the last 4-6 weeks to familiarize myself with the new world
                that I am entering into, but the learning curve is steep. With that being said I am very much
                looking forward to starting this Bootcamp and getting to really dive in and absorb as
                much as I can. My goal for the next few months is to get myself to a point where I have
                the basics down of the most commonly used coding languages, the concepts needed to put
                those languages into use and an overall understanding of how these all work together to
                provide something (hopefully) useful. I know I will not be a master of anything in 10
                weeks time but I’d love to be to a point where I can continue my education in the field
                and begin putting my new skills into action in a way that will allow me to support myself
                while traveling. </p>
